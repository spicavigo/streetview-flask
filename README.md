# Drive Google Street View Car

Set the start and end location and Density. Click on "Create Video". Once the rendering is done, you can either download the video or view it on the webpage itself. The speed setting on the webpage is inverse, i.e lower value means higher speed.

The video will fail to load if the Google API Key I am using hits the Quota. In that case, set the KEY in app.py and static/js/map.js

Dependencies:
Python
